# The Spending List

AI-powered analysis of government contract spending data from USASpending.gov. Built to promote transparency and help citizens understand how public funds are used.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **AI:** Groq (Llama 3.1), Claude (optional)
- **Deployment:** Railway / Docker
- **Rate Limiting:** Upstash Redis

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered contract analysis and scoring (1-10 scale)
- 🔍 Search and filter government contracts
- 📊 Admin dashboard for data management
- 🗺️ Dynamic sitemap generation for SEO
- 📈 Contract categorization and scoring
- 🔗 Direct links to USASpending.gov for verification

## Development Setup

### Option 1: Standard Development (Current Workflow)

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thespendinglist
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Set up database:**

```bash
npm run db:push
```

4. **Run development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Docker Development

Run the entire stack (app + PostgreSQL) with Docker:

1. **Build and start containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. **Run database migrations (first time only):**

```bash
docker-compose exec app npx prisma db push
```

3. **Stop containers:**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Note:** You'll need to add your API keys to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Production Deployment

### Railway (Current Method)

- Push to GitHub
- Railway auto-detects Next.js and builds
- Set environment variables in Railway dashboard

### Docker (Alternative)

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t thespendinglist .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=your-database-url \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  thespendinglist
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run db:push      # Push Prisma schema to database
npm run db:migrate   # Create database migration
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio
```

## Admin Dashboard

Access at `/api/admin` with your admin key.

Features:

- Crawl USASpending.gov for new contracts
- View analytics and statistics
- Manage contract entries

## Key Design Decisions

- **AI Analysis Removed:** Originally included detailed contract analysis with Claude, but removed to reduce legal liability while maintaining core scoring functionality
- **Simple Scoring:** Uses Llama 3.1 for straightforward 1-10 price reasonableness scores
- **No Contractor Accusations:** Focuses on contract terms only, not contractor history
- **Educational Focus:** Promotes transparency without making accusations
